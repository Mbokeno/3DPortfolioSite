# React + Vite

This is a project that uses React + Vite. My references when coding this project come from a grass shader sandbox I found https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/grass-shader-5xho4, and this very cool 3D portfolio I came across while researching iframes in a 3D space, https://henryheffernan.com/. This project consists of two sites, the 3D site and the 2D site. The 2D site (https://mbokeno.github.io/2DPortfolio/) is put an iframe in the 3D site that was placed over the tv model's screen. The music is a beautiful piano rendition of one of my favorite game OSTs, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl's Lake Verity. The cover is done by this gentleman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED5NBW08vHc! Please support his work. Press 'M' to play/pause the audio. Click on the tv to zoom in.
